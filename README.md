Magen is a platform that integrates encrypted file sharing, identity management and policy enforcement. It allows users to share encrypted files backed by identity management coupled with policy enforcement, also known as context aware identity management.

Magen is composed of stand-alone Microservices: frontend, ingestion server and key server. Microseservices communicate with each other through a REST API. The front end exposes a web UI that implements user registration, file management (upload, sharing, deletion) and policy attachment. Files are automatically encrypted after upload.
